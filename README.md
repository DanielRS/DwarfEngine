# Dwarf Engine
A game engine written in C++
It aims to provide a simple set of tools for casual game development (in fact is more similar to a framework than an engine)

## What's done until now?

The engine is very simple at this time, it includes the following functionalities:

* OpenGL wrappers (Shaders, Textures, etc)
* Utility classes for graphics (SpriteBatch, Camera, Post effects, Image loading, etc)
* Multi-platform input support
* Math classes (Matrix, Vector, Random numbers)
* Resource Manager

All the code can be found inside **src/** folder, it should be easy to learn from it.

1. Write a better README.md
2. Upload some examples
